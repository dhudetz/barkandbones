    "info1": "My name is Sarah Hudetz. I personally make all my Bark and Bones doggie treats. I live in Wilmington, Illinois. Here is a brief recap of how my business got started. Covid struck! I lost my job at a workshop but not my work ethic. I decided to move in next door to my parents, who I love very much. I absolutely had to come up with something to do to keep me busy and make some money. I started a hobby of making doggie treats for my dog Charlie.",
    "info2": "One day we were in the car and started talking about a dog treats business. We needed a name. Different family members came up with some interesting names, like Bark and Boners, Aunt Sarah’s Bones, Sarah’s Dog Treats. I ended up picking Bark and Bones. That was two plus years ago and I’m still going strong."
